Goals for logger:

-lumberjack ai:


//needs cleaning up
Split up states to classes:
	
	make all states go back to idle //done
	
//all done
	Idle: 	Are there trees in range to chop?
		Are there logs in range to pickup?
		Are there logs in range to walk to?
		Are there trees in range to walk to?
		else
			go to rest area

	walk to tree (MoveToTree class) //done
	cut tree //done
	pick up tree //done

FIX THIS NEXT:
	make building by water, make npc go to building to drop in river
	walk to river
	drop in river

-water "physics"
	move objects in stream along stream
	or
	take objects and put them at end of stream

-buildings
	net (log accepter)
	sawmill (take log and create plank)
	seller
